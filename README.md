### **Battery SoC & SoH Estimation**

* **SoC (State of Charge):** Represents the remaining charge of a battery as a percentage of its full capacity.

  * Methods: Coulomb counting, Kalman filter, model-based estimation.

* **SoH (State of Health):** Indicates battery health compared to its nominal condition.

  * Key indicator: **Râ‚€ (internal resistance)**; increases as battery degrades.
  * Methods: Pulse test, model-based EKF/filters, voltage-current analysis.

* **Applications:** Battery management systems (BMS), EVs, energy storage systems, predictive maintenance.
